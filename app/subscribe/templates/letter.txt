Hi, potential investors!


First, thank you for participating our mailing list.
Your supporting from the whole world gives us huge power. :)

Our ICO project is for supporting human translators’ continuous profit in current and future AI generation.
Currently, humans got paid from customers and that’s all.
And they could do nothing when AI translator appears and translation cost dreadfully decreased.
But by our project, human translators contribute to us, and we will lease the bunch of data to research or companies. Then, the profits will be shared by translators’ contribution.
And the token can also be used in conventional translation business as a currency. By that, customers can request a translation, pay by cryptocurrency, and use AI models.

Somebody said we are ICX dApp, but WE HAVE NEVER FIXED YET. We’re talking with ICX, EOS, SMT, and etc.
We were just selected to ICX dApp contest by Korean crypto celebrities.
Please check out our slides of the contest.

Currently we are in private sale phase, and exchange rate, hardcap were not fixed yet.
They will be fixed after conventional investors and cryptofunds join us.
We’ll mail to you when our business paper, technical paper, and whitepaper are released one by one!

So, first of all, I’d like to ask for participating a simple survey to check the demand of investment.
If you participate now, I’ll give you a priority when bounty programs open.

More, if you know any translation agencies that agree with our vision, please introduce us to them.
And, we want them to be a roll of exchange between our token and their real currency for human translators’ encashment. If they can help with it, it'll be great help of us!

Please stay in touch! :)


Many thanks,
LangChain team (former Mother of Language)
